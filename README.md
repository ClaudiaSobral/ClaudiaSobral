### Hello! I'm Claudia Sobral 😄

I'm a Brazilian based data enthusiast, fascinated by learning more about the world throught data! Nice to meet you.

🔍 Data Science and Dataviz are currently my passion, so I'm diving into these areas by learning Python with [prograMaria](https://www.programaria.org/), a Brazilian platform aimed at bringing more diversity to tech, and DataCamp, a online learning platform focused especifically in Data Science and Data Analytics.

📊 Projects & Portfolio: Here, you’ll find projects showcasing my skills in data science and visualization. I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to apply what I learn and contribute to the community.

🎨 Beyond Data: when I'm coding, you can find me exploring the world of animation. Creativity and passion for different forms of expression help me bring new perspectives to my projects.

🇧🇷 🇫🇷: I'm a native speaker of Portuguese and a speaker of French for the passion of it. The love for learning new languages definetely has lead me to coding in the Data world.

To contact me, it is really simple: make us a really nice cup of coffee and send it to:
